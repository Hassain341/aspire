                    Often, there is confusion about what exactly counts as digital marketing, and we get why! It is a
                    vast field but simply put, digital marketing can include any marketing which happens in the online
                    realm and/or which involves a phone, laptop, tablet, or another device, which can connect to the
                    internet.
                    A social media post, a paid ad on Google, SEO efforts, a blog post, an email, or an app are all
                    small examples of the overall world of digital marketing.

                    The way people consume information and content has changed with the times, and businesses need a
                    strong online presence in order to find, attract, and keep customers.Digital and online channels
                    have been part of our lives for decades now, but usage of mobile phones, the internet, and other

                What are SEO and SEM?
                <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron down"></i>

                    SEO stands for search engine optimization. It is the process of using different tactics and actions
                    to make a website or webpages appear higher up in search results when people use search engines like
                    Google.
                    SEM stands for search engine marketing. Although it is also designed to help web pages appear when
                    users enter search queries, it focuses mainly on paid results. That is, results appear but are paid
                    for when users interact with these results.

                Can you do it yourself, or do you need an agency?

                    That depends on who you are, really! Often, business owners, marketers, or entrepreneurs can do
                    certain parts of digital marketing, but not all of it. An agency can be helpful in terms of devising
                    a coherent strategy, allowing you to make use of experts to get better results, and figuring out
                    where to best spend your money. But you do not have to outsource all (or any) of it, especially if
                    you are willing to learn and already have a knack for, say, writing social media captions or
                    interpreting analytics data.

                How much does digital marketing cost?
                <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron down"></i>
            </button>
            <div class="pannel">
                <p>
                    Much like any other marketing, costs can vary dramatically from business to business. However,
                    unlike traditional marketing, there are some ways to leverage digital marketing for free. SEO, for
                    instance, is largely free and requires only your time and effort. Starting and posting to a social
                    media page is free or very low-cost too.
                    Depending on your skills, you will likely also need to pay someone to implement and manage various
                    strategies which will help you to succeed in the online space.
